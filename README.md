# Tech Blog - Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge

## Description

This project is a CMS-style blog application where developers can publish blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. Built following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, the app uses **Handlebars.js** as the templating language, **Sequelize** as the ORM for interacting with a **PostgreSQL** database, and **express-session** for authentication. The site allows users to create accounts, log in, publish blog posts, and engage with other posts through comments. 

The application is deployed on **Render** for hosting.
